# Agent Mesh Protocol (AMP) -- HTTP Wire Binding Specification

    Version: 1.0.0
    Status: Normative
    Date: 2026-04-10
    Authors: AMP Contributors
    Specification URI: https://amp-protocol.dev/spec/wire-binding/1.0

## Abstract

This document specifies the HTTP wire binding for the Agent Mesh Protocol
(AMP). It defines how AMP messages are transported over HTTP, including
endpoint structure, request and response formats, error handling, streaming,
session management, security, and compliance. An implementer reading this
document alone MUST be able to build an interoperable AMP-compliant agent in
any programming language without reference to any specific implementation.

## Status of This Document

This is a normative specification. Implementations claiming AMP conformance
MUST implement the mandatory portions (Level 0) and SHOULD implement
higher levels as declared in their agent.json document.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The Agent Mesh Protocol (AMP) enables autonomous software agents to
discover, authenticate, and communicate with one another across
organizational and platform boundaries. This document specifies how AMP
messages are encoded, transported, and interpreted over HTTP.

AMP is transport-agnostic by design. This document defines the HTTP
binding -- the primary and RECOMMENDED transport. Future documents MAY
define bindings for other transports (e.g., gRPC, WebSocket).

### 1.2 Design Philosophy

AMP follows the same philosophy as HTTP itself:

- **Minimal mandatory surface.** The only mandatory requirement is
  serving a static JSON file at a well-known URL (Level 0). Everything
  else is opt-in.
- **Progressive capability.** Agents declare what they support. Callers
  adapt. An agent on a Raspberry Pi and an agent backed by a
  hyperscaler cluster speak the same protocol at different levels.
- **Forward compatibility.** Unknown headers MUST be ignored. Unknown
  body types MUST be accepted. This guarantees that agents built today
  will not break when the protocol evolves.
- **Single endpoint core.** All message types flow through one POST
  endpoint. The `body_type` field is the semantic routing key, not the
  HTTP method or URL path.

### 1.3 Conformance Levels

AMP defines six progressive conformance levels:

| Level | Name        | Mandatory | Summary                                      |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Discovery   | YES       | Serve `agent.json`, respond to health checks |
| 1     | Messaging   | No        | Accept and process messages                  |
| 2     | Tools       | No        | Expose and invoke callable tools             |
| 3     | Streaming   | No        | Real-time event delivery via SSE             |
| 4     | Identity    | No        | Sessions, handshake, delegation, events      |
| 5     | Full        | No        | All 8 capability groups                      |

Only Level 0 is MANDATORY. An implementation that serves a valid
`agent.json` document and responds to health checks is a conforming
AMP agent, even if it accepts no messages.

### 1.4 Scope

This specification covers:

- HTTP endpoints, methods, and URL structure
- Request and response envelope formats (JSON)
- Error encoding (RFC 7807)
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming
- Session handshake and binding
- Tool discovery and invocation
- Task lifecycle state transitions
- Authentication and trust tier resolution
- Compliance headers and erasure flows
- Standard headers and their semantics
- Extensibility and versioning

This specification does NOT cover:

- Internal agent architecture or runtime design
- Specific cryptographic library choices
- Registry federation governance
- Business logic for task routing
- NAT traversal, relay infrastructure, or tunneling

## 2. Conventions and Terminology

### 2.1 Key Words

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [RFC 2119] [RFC 8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

### 2.2 Definitions

- **Agent**: An autonomous software entity that communicates via AMP.
- **Sender**: The agent originating a message.
- **Receiver**: The agent processing an incoming message.
- **Envelope**: The `AgentMessage` JSON object that wraps all communication.
- **Body type**: A dot-namespaced string (e.g., `task.create`) that
  determines the semantic meaning of the message body.
- **Trust tier**: One of four relationship levels (internal, owner,
  verified, external) that determines which security checks apply.
- **Capability group**: One of eight functional areas an agent MAY
  support (messaging, streaming, tools, identity, session, delegation,
  presence, events).
- **Capability level**: An integer (0--5) auto-computed from the set of
  active capability groups.

### 2.3 URI Notation

Throughout this document, `{base}` refers to the agent's base URL as
declared in the `endpoint` field of its `agent.json` document. For
example, if `endpoint` is `https://acme.example.com/agent/message`,
then `{base}` is `https://acme.example.com`.

Path-based endpoints are relative to `{base}` unless stated otherwise.

---

## 3. Transport Requirements

### 3.1 Protocol

The HTTP binding uses HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) as the underlying transport.

- Implementations MUST use HTTPS for production deployments.
- Implementations MAY use plain HTTP for development and testing
  environments.
- Implementations SHOULD support HTTP/2 for performance.
- Implementations MAY support HTTP/3 (QUIC).

### 3.2 Content Type

- Implementations MUST support `application/json` as the content type
  for request and response bodies.
- Implementations MAY support additional content types (e.g.,
  `application/cbor`, `application/msgpack`) as extensions.
- If a request does not include a `Content-Type` header, the receiver
  MUST assume `application/json`.

### 3.3 Character Encoding

- All JSON payloads MUST be encoded in UTF-8 [RFC 3629].
- Implementations MUST NOT use a byte-order mark (BOM).

### 3.4 Message Size

- Implementations MUST accept messages up to 10 MiB (10,485,760 bytes).
- Implementations MAY accept larger messages.
- Implementations MUST reject messages exceeding their configured limit
  with HTTP 413 (Payload Too Large) and an error response per Section 7.

### 3.5 TLS Requirements

For production deployments:

- Implementations MUST use TLS 1.2 or higher.
- Implementations SHOULD use TLS 1.3.
- Implementations MUST present a valid X.509 certificate for the
  agent's hostname.
- Implementations SHOULD support certificate transparency (CT) logs.

### 3.6 Connection Management

- Implementations SHOULD use persistent connections (HTTP keep-alive).
- Implementations SHOULD set reasonable timeouts:
  - Connect timeout: 10 seconds (RECOMMENDED)
  - Read timeout: 30 seconds (RECOMMENDED)
  - Streaming read timeout: none (kept alive by heartbeats)

---

## 4. Discovery -- Level 0 (MANDATORY)

Level 0 is the only MANDATORY conformance level. Every AMP agent MUST
implement the two endpoints defined in this section.

### 4.1 Agent Identity Document

```
GET /.well-known/agent.json
```

This endpoint returns the agent's identity document -- a JSON object
describing who the agent is, what it can do, and how to reach it. The
URL follows the Well-Known URIs pattern [RFC 8615].

#### 4.1.1 Request

No request body. No required headers.

```http
GET /.well-known/agent.json HTTP/1.1
Host: bakery.example.com
Accept: application/json
```

#### 4.1.2 Response

The response MUST be a JSON object with `Content-Type: application/json`.

**Required fields** (MUST be present):

| Field              | Type     | Description                                        |
|--------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|

| `identifiers`      | string[] | All `agent://` URIs for this agent                 |
| `endpoint`         | string   | HTTPS URL for `POST /agent/message`                |

**Optional fields** (MAY be present):

| Field               | Type     | Description                                              |
|----------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|

| `security`           | object   | Authentication methods, trust requirements               |
| `billing`            | object   | Cost model and payment information                       |
| `streaming`          | object   | Streaming configuration (heartbeat interval, etc.)       |
| `compliance`         | object   | Jurisdiction, retention, and data handling policies      |
| `languages`          | string[] | BCP 47 language tags the agent supports                  |
| `ttl_seconds`        | integer  | Cache lifetime in seconds (RECOMMENDED default: 3600)    |
| `visibility`         | object   | Visibility level and contact policy                      |
| `supported_schemas`  | string[] | Context schema URNs the agent understands                |
| `status`             | string   | Lifecycle status: `active`, `deactivating`, `decommissioned` |
| `moved_to`           | string   | `agent://` URI this agent has migrated to                |
| `certifications`     | object[] | Compliance certifications (SOC2, ISO 27001, etc.)        |

Implementations MUST allow unknown fields in `agent.json`. Consumers
MUST ignore fields they do not understand.

      "url": "https://bakery.example.com/compliance/soc2",
      "valid_until": "2027-01-15"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 4.1.5 Caching

- `agent.json` SHOULD include a `ttl_seconds` field indicating how long
  consumers MAY cache the document.
- If `ttl_seconds` is absent, consumers SHOULD assume a default TTL of
  3600 seconds (1 hour).
- Consumers SHOULD cache `agent.json` and MUST NOT fetch it on every
  message.
- Implementations SHOULD set appropriate HTTP `Cache-Control` headers
  consistent with `ttl_seconds`.

#### 4.1.6 Conditional Serving

Implementations MAY serve different versions of `agent.json` based on
the caller's trust tier. For example:

- **PUBLIC visibility**: Return full document to all callers.
- **AUTHENTICATED visibility**: Return full document to verified
  callers; return a stub (only `protocol_version`, `identifiers`,
  `endpoint`, `visibility`) to unauthenticated callers.
- **PRIVATE visibility**: Return full document to internal/owner
  callers; return HTTP 401 to others.
- **HIDDEN visibility**: Return full document to internal/owner
  callers; return HTTP 404 to others.

When conditional serving is in use, the server SHOULD examine the
`Authorization` header of the `GET /.well-known/agent.json` request
to determine the caller's trust tier.

#### 4.1.7 Agent Lifecycle

The `status` field indicates the agent's lifecycle state:

| Status           | Meaning                                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `active`         | Agent is operational and accepting messages            |
| `deactivating`   | Agent is winding down; new tasks SHOULD NOT be sent    |
| `decommissioned` | Agent is permanently offline; `moved_to` MAY be set    |

When `status` is `decommissioned` and `moved_to` is present, consumers
SHOULD follow the `moved_to` URI. Consumers MUST validate that
`moved_to` is a well-formed `agent://` URI before following it.

### 4.2 Health Check

```
GET /agent/health
```

This endpoint returns the agent's operational status. It is intended for
monitoring, load balancers, and liveness probes.

#### 4.2.1 Request

No request body. No required headers.

```http
GET /agent/health HTTP/1.1
Host: bakery.example.com
Accept: application/json
```

#### 4.2.2 Response

The response MUST be a JSON object with `Content-Type: application/json`.

**Required fields** (MUST be present):

| Field              | Type   | Description                                    |
|--------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| `status`           | string | `"healthy"` or `"unhealthy"`                   |
| `protocol_version` | string | Semantic version of the AMP protocol in use    |

**Optional fields** (MAY be present):

| Field            | Type    | Description                                      |
|------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `uptime_seconds` | integer | Seconds since the agent process started          |
| `current_tasks`  | integer | Number of tasks currently being processed        |
| `max_tasks`      | integer | Maximum concurrent tasks the agent supports      |

#### 4.2.3 Example

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "healthy",
  "protocol_version": "1.0.0",
  "uptime_seconds": 86400,
  "current_tasks": 3,
  "max_tasks": 50
}
```

#### 4.2.4 Status Codes

| Code | Condition                                    |
|------|----------------------------------------------|
| 200  | Agent is healthy                             |
| 503  | Agent is unhealthy or temporarily unavailable |

### 4.3 JWKS Endpoint

```
GET /.well-known/agent-keys.json
```

If the agent's `agent.json` includes a `jwks_url` field, that URL MUST
serve a JSON Web Key Set [RFC 7517] containing the agent's public keys.

This endpoint is OPTIONAL. It is REQUIRED only for agents that
authenticate via JWT or sign delegation chains.

#### 4.3.1 Example

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "OKP",
      "crv": "Ed25519",
      "x": "11qYAYKxCrfVS_7TyWQHOg7hcvPapiMlrwIaaPcHURo",
      "kid": "key-2026-04",
      "use": "sig"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 4.3.2 Key Rotation

- Implementations SHOULD serve both the current and previous key to
  allow for rotation lag.
- Consumers SHOULD cache JWKS responses for the duration indicated by
  HTTP `Cache-Control` headers.
- Consumers SHOULD refresh the JWKS if signature verification fails
  with the cached key set.

---

## 5. Messaging -- Level 1

Level 1 agents accept and process messages via a single HTTP endpoint.

### 5.1 The Message Endpoint

```
POST /agent/message
```

This is the primary communication endpoint. ALL AMP message types are
delivered as POST requests to this single URL. The `body_type` field
within the JSON envelope determines the semantic meaning.

#### 5.1.1 Request Format

The request body MUST be a JSON object conforming to the `AgentMessage`
envelope schema:

| Field       | Type   | Required | Description                                          |
|-------------|--------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `sender`    | string | YES      | Agent address of the sender (`agent://` URI, `@slug`, or URL) |
| `recipient` | string | YES      | Agent address of the intended recipient              |
| `id`        | string | YES      | Unique message identifier (UUID v4 RECOMMENDED)      |
| `body_type` | string | YES      | Dot-namespaced type string (e.g., `"message"`, `"task.create"`) |
| `headers`   | object | NO       | Extensible key-value headers (see Section 14)        |
| `body`      | any    | NO       | Message payload, structure determined by `body_type` |

#### 5.1.2 Request Example

```http
POST /agent/message HTTP/1.1
Host: bakery.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9...

{
  "sender": "agent://alice@registry.example.com",
  "recipient": "agent://bakery.example.com",
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "body_type": "task.create",
  "headers": {
    "Protocol-Version": "1.0.0",
    "Priority": "normal",
    "Callback-URL": "https://alice.example.com/callbacks/task-result",
    "Nonce": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
    "Trace-Id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736",
    "Span-Id": "00f067aa0ba902b7"
  },
  "body": {
    "description": "Find the nearest open bakery and order 2 croissants",
    "priority": "normal",
    "timeout_seconds": 300,
    "context": {
      "location": "40.7128,-74.0060",
      "dietary": "no-gluten"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 5.1.3 Envelope Rules

1. The `sender` field MUST contain a valid agent address. Within a
   platform boundary, bare slugs (`@alice`) are acceptable. For
   cross-platform communication, senders MUST use full `agent://` URIs.

2. The `recipient` field MUST match one of the receiving agent's
   declared identifiers.

3. The `id` field MUST be unique per sender. Implementations SHOULD use
   UUID v4. Receivers SHOULD use this field for deduplication (see
   Section 12.5).

4. The `body_type` field determines which schema applies to the `body`.
   See Section 16 for the canonical body type registry.

5. The `headers` field is an open-ended key-value map. Receivers MUST
   ignore headers they do not understand. This is the primary
   extensibility mechanism.

6. The `body` field MAY be any JSON value (object, array, string,
   number, boolean, or null). Its structure is determined by the
   `body_type`. For unknown body types, receivers MUST accept the body
   without schema validation.

#### 5.1.4 Unknown Body Types

Receivers MUST accept messages with unknown `body_type` values. The
receiver MAY:

- Pass the message through to a handler that understands it
- Store the message for later processing
- Return a `task.reject` response indicating the body type is not
  supported
- Silently acknowledge receipt

Receivers MUST NOT reject unknown body types at the transport level
(i.e., MUST NOT return HTTP 400 solely because the body type is
unrecognized).

#### 5.1.5 Unknown Headers

Receivers MUST ignore headers they do not understand. This rule is
critical for forward compatibility. A sender using protocol version
1.2 that sends a header introduced in 1.2 MUST NOT cause a version 1.0
receiver to fail.

### 5.2 Response Format

The response to `POST /agent/message` indicates whether the message was
accepted for processing. The response body MAY contain a synchronous
reply or an asynchronous acknowledgment.

#### 5.2.1 Synchronous Response (200 OK)

When the receiver can produce a complete result immediately:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sender": "agent://bakery.example.com",
  "recipient": "agent://alice@registry.example.com",
  "id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
  "body_type": "task.complete",
  "headers": {
    "In-Reply-To": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",

  },
  "body": {
    "task_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",

      "total_usd": 7.50
    },
    "duration_seconds": 2.3,
    "cost_usd": 0.002
  }
}
```

#### 5.2.2 Asynchronous Acknowledgment (202 Accepted)

When the receiver cannot produce an immediate result:

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sender": "agent://bakery.example.com",
  "recipient": "agent://alice@registry.example.com",
  "id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002",
  "body_type": "task.acknowledge",
  "headers": {
    "In-Reply-To": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "Protocol-Version": "1.0.0",
    "Poll-Interval": "5"
  },
  "body": {
    "task_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "estimated_duration_seconds": 60,
    "message": "Looking for bakeries near your location"
  }
}
```

#### 5.2.3 Rejection (200 OK with task.reject)

When the receiver declines to process the message:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sender": "agent://bakery.example.com",
  "recipient": "agent://alice@registry.example.com",
  "id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003",
  "body_type": "task.reject",
  "headers": {
    "In-Reply-To": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  },
  "body": {

    "retry_eligible": true,
    "retry_after_seconds": 28800
  }
}
```

## 6. Response Semantics

### 6.1 Delivery Mechanisms

When a receiver returns HTTP 202 (Accepted), the eventual result MUST
be delivered through one of three mechanisms. The SENDER chooses the
mechanism; the receiver MUST support at least one.

#### 6.1.1 Callback (Push)

The sender includes a `Callback-URL` header in the original message.
The receiver delivers the result by POSTing an `AgentMessage` envelope
to that URL.

**Sender requirements:**
- The `Callback-URL` MUST be an HTTPS URL.
- The sender MUST accept POST requests at the callback URL.
- The sender SHOULD keep the callback URL valid for at least the
  duration of the task timeout.

**Receiver requirements:**
- The receiver MUST validate the callback URL before accepting the
  message (see Section 12.8).
- The receiver MUST deliver the result as a POST request containing an
  `AgentMessage` envelope.
- The receiver SHOULD retry delivery on failure using exponential
  backoff: 1 second, 5 seconds, 25 seconds (3 attempts total).
- The receiver MUST perform SSRF validation on the callback URL. The
  URL MUST NOT resolve to a private, loopback, or link-local IP
  address.
- The receiver SHOULD pin DNS resolution on the first attempt and reuse
  the resolved IP for all retry attempts to prevent DNS rebinding
  attacks.

**Callback delivery example:**

```http
POST /callbacks/task-result HTTP/1.1
Host: alice.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sender": "agent://bakery.example.com",
  "recipient": "agent://alice@registry.example.com",
  "id": "770e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440004",
  "body_type": "task.complete",
  "headers": {
    "In-Reply-To": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  },
  "body": {
    "task_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "result": {"bakery": "La Boulangerie", "order_id": "ORD-001"}
  }
}
```

#### 6.1.2 Polling (Pull)

The sender polls the receiver for the task status using the task ID.

```
GET /agent/tasks/{task_id}
```

**Response:**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "task_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "status": "processing",
  "progress": {
    "percentage": 45,
    "message": "Found 3 bakeries, checking availability"
  },
  "created_at": "2026-04-10T14:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-04-10T14:30:05Z"
}
```

When the task is complete:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "task_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "status": "completed",
  "result": {
    "sender": "agent://bakery.example.com",
    "recipient": "agent://alice@registry.example.com",
    "id": "770e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440004",
    "body_type": "task.complete",
    "headers": {
      "In-Reply-To": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    },
    "body": {
      "task_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "result": {"bakery": "La Boulangerie", "order_id": "ORD-001"}
    }
  },
  "created_at": "2026-04-10T14:30:00Z",
  "completed_at": "2026-04-10T14:30:12Z"
}
```

**Polling guidance:**
- The receiver SHOULD include a `Poll-Interval` header in the 202
  response indicating the RECOMMENDED polling interval in seconds.
- The sender SHOULD NOT poll more frequently than the indicated
  interval.
- If no `Poll-Interval` is provided, the sender SHOULD default to
  5-second intervals.

#### 6.1.3 Streaming (Push via SSE)

The sender opens an SSE connection to receive real-time updates. See
Section 8 for full streaming semantics.

### 6.2 Result Delivery Selection

The sender indicates its preferred delivery mechanism through headers:

| Header         | Mechanism                                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Callback-URL` | Result delivered via POST to the callback URL   |
| (none)         | Sender will poll `GET /agent/tasks/{task_id}`   |

If the sender includes `Callback-URL`, the receiver MUST attempt
callback delivery. If callback delivery fails after all retries, the
result MUST still be available via polling.

Streaming is an additional channel that operates independently. The
sender MAY use streaming AND callback/polling simultaneously.

---

## 7. Error Format

### 7.1 Problem Details (RFC 7807)

All error responses MUST use the Problem Details format defined in
RFC 7807 [RFC 7807]. The `Content-Type` for error responses MUST be
`application/problem+json`.

#### 7.1.1 Error Object Schema

| Field      | Type    | Required | Description                                  |
|------------|---------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `type`     | string  | YES      | URI identifying the error type               |
| `title`    | string  | YES      | Short human-readable summary                 |
| `status`   | integer | YES      | HTTP status code                             |
| `detail`   | string  | NO       | Human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence |
| `instance` | string  | NO       | URI identifying the specific occurrence      |

Implementations MAY include additional fields as extension members.

#### 7.1.2 Error Type URIs

Error type URIs MUST use the `urn:amp:error:` prefix for standard AMP
errors. Implementations MAY define custom error types using
reverse-domain notation (e.g., `urn:com.example:error:custom`).

### 7.2 Standard Error Types

The following error types are defined by this specification:

#### 7.2.1 400 -- Invalid Message

```json
{
  "type": "urn:amp:error:invalid-message",
  "title": "Invalid Message",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "Field 'sender' is required but was not provided",

field SHOULD indicate which field or constraint was violated.

#### 7.2.2 401 -- Unauthorized

```json
{
  "type": "urn:amp:error:unauthorized",
  "title": "Unauthorized",
  "status": 401,

{
  "type": "urn:amp:error:version-mismatch",
  "title": "Protocol Version Not Supported",
  "status": 406,

  "status": 429,
  "detail": "Sender exceeded 60 requests per minute",
  "retry_after_seconds": 30
}
```

Returned when the sender has exceeded the rate limit. The response
MUST include a `Retry-After` HTTP header and SHOULD include
`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset`
headers.

Returned when the receiver encounters an unrecoverable internal error.
The `detail` field SHOULD NOT expose implementation details that could
be exploited.

#### 7.2.12 501 -- Not Implemented

```json
{
  "type": "urn:amp:error:not-implemented",
  "title": "Not Implemented",
  "status": 501,
  "detail": "This agent does not support the 'delegation' capability group"
}
```

Returned when a message requires a capability the agent has not
implemented.

  "title": "Service Unavailable",
  "status": 503,
  "detail": "Agent is temporarily overloaded",
  "retry_after_seconds": 60
}
```

Returned when the agent is temporarily unable to process requests.
The response SHOULD include a `Retry-After` HTTP header.

---

## 8. Streaming

### 8.1 Overview

AMP streaming uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) [W3C SSE] to deliver
real-time processing updates from a receiver to a sender. Streaming
is OPTIONAL (Level 3+).

### 8.2 Stream Endpoint

```
GET /agent/stream
```

#### 8.2.1 Request

```http
GET /agent/stream?session_id=sess-001&task_id=task-001 HTTP/1.1
Host: bakery.example.com
Accept: text/event-stream
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9...
```

**Query parameters** (all OPTIONAL):

| Parameter    | Description                                    |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `session_id` | Filter events to a specific session           |
| `task_id`    | Filter events to a specific task              |
| `channel_id` | Filter events to a specific multiplexed channel |
| `last_seq`   | Resume from a specific sequence number        |

#### 8.2.2 Response Headers

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/event-stream
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: keep-alive
X-Accel-Buffering: no
```

### 8.3 Event Format

Each event follows the SSE specification:

```
id: <event_id>
event: <event_type>
data: <json_payload>

```

Events are separated by a blank line. The `data` field MUST be a
JSON-encoded object.

#### 8.3.1 Event Fields

| Field   | Required | Description                                     |
|---------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `id`    | NO       | Event ID for reconnection via `Last-Event-ID`   |
| `event` | YES      | One of the 17 defined event types (see 8.4)     |
| `data`  | YES      | JSON object with event-specific payload         |

All events carry a `seq` field within the `data` payload -- a
monotonically increasing integer starting at 1 for each stream
connection.

### 8.4 Event Types

| Event Type             | Description                                | Category     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `thinking`             | Agent is reasoning                         | Processing   |
| `tool_call`            | Agent is invoking a tool                   | Processing   |
| `tool_result`          | Tool returned a result                     | Processing   |
| `text_delta`           | Partial text response (streaming output)   | Processing   |
| `state_change`         | Task status changed                        | Lifecycle    |
| `agent_call`           | Agent is delegating to another agent       | Delegation   |
| `agent_result`         | Delegated agent returned a result          | Delegation   |
| `error`                | An error occurred                          | Error        |
| `heartbeat`            | Keepalive (no payload required)            | Control      |
| `done`                 | Final event -- stream complete             | Control      |
| `stream.ack`           | Client acknowledges processed events       | Backpressure |
| `stream.pause`         | Server pauses the stream                   | Backpressure |
| `stream.resume`        | Client signals readiness for more events   | Backpressure |
| `stream.channel_open`  | Open a logical multiplexed channel         | Multiplexing |
| `stream.channel_close` | Close a logical multiplexed channel        | Multiplexing |
| `stream.checkpoint`    | Periodic state snapshot for reconnection   | Reliability  |
| `stream.auth_refresh`  | Mid-stream token renewal                   | Security     |

#### 8.4.1 Processing Events

**thinking**

```
event: thinking
data: {"seq": 1, "message": "Searching for bakeries near the specified location"}

```

**tool_call**

```
event: tool_call
data: {"seq": 2, "tool": "geocode_search", "parameters": {"query": "bakery", "lat": 40.7128, "lon": -74.006, "radius_km": 5}}

```

**tool_result**

```
event: tool_result
data: {"seq": 3, "tool": "geocode_search", "result": {"matches": 3, "nearest": "La Boulangerie"}}

```

**text_delta**

```
event: text_delta
data: {"seq": 4, "delta": "I found La Boulangerie, "}

event: text_delta
data: {"seq": 5, "delta": "which is 0.8km from your location."}

```

**state_change**

```
event: state_change
data: {"seq": 6, "task_id": "task-001", "from": "processing", "to": "completed"}

```

#### 8.4.2 Control Events

**heartbeat**

```
event: heartbeat
data: {"seq": 7}

```

Heartbeats MUST be sent at a regular interval to keep the connection
alive. The RECOMMENDED interval is 15 seconds. The actual interval is
implementation-defined and SHOULD be declared in the `streaming`
section of `agent.json`.

**done**

```
event: done
data: {"seq": 8, "task_id": "task-001"}

```

The `done` event signals that no more events will be emitted for the
indicated task (or for the entire stream if `task_id` is absent).
After receiving `done`, the client MAY close the connection.

### 8.5 Reconnection

Clients SHOULD implement automatic reconnection using the SSE
`Last-Event-ID` mechanism:

1. The client records the `id` field of the last received event.
2. On disconnection, the client reconnects with:
   ```
   Last-Event-ID: <last_event_id>
   ```
3. The server resumes the stream from the event after the specified ID.

If the server cannot resume (e.g., events have been purged), it MUST
start a fresh stream and SHOULD emit a `stream.checkpoint` event with
the current state.

### 8.6 Backpressure

Backpressure prevents a fast producer from overwhelming a slow consumer.

#### 8.6.1 Stream Acknowledgment

The client sends `stream.ack` events to indicate which events have been
processed:

```json
{
  "last_seq": 42,
  "timestamp": "2026-04-10T14:30:15Z"
}
```

The client SHOULD send an acknowledgment at least every 10 events or
every 5 seconds, whichever comes first.

#### 8.6.2 Stream Pause

When the server detects the client is falling behind (e.g., no `ack`
for 30+ events), it emits a `stream.pause` event:

```
event: stream.pause
data: {"reason": "client_behind", "resume_after_ack": 42}

```

The server MUST stop emitting new events (except heartbeats) until the
client catches up.

#### 8.6.3 Stream Resume

The client signals readiness by sending a `stream.resume`:

```json
{
  "from_seq": 42,
  "buffer_capacity": 100
}
```

The backpressure implementation strategy (ACK frequency, buffer sizing,
pause thresholds) is guidance. Implementations MAY use different
strategies as long as the event types are respected.

### 8.7 Channel Multiplexing

A single SSE connection MAY carry events for multiple logical channels
(e.g., multiple concurrent tasks).

#### 8.7.1 Opening a Channel

```
event: stream.channel_open
data: {"channel_id": "ch-001", "task_id": "task-001", "created_at": "2026-04-10T14:30:00Z"}

```

All subsequent events for the channel include the `channel_id` in
the `Stream-Channel` header of the envelope or as a field in the
event data.

#### 8.7.2 Closing a Channel

```
event: stream.channel_close
data: {"channel_id": "ch-001", "reason": "complete"}

```

Valid close reasons: `complete`, `error`, `timeout`.

### 8.8 Checkpointing

The server SHOULD periodically emit `stream.checkpoint` events to
enable efficient reconnection:

```
event: stream.checkpoint
data: {"checkpoint_id": "cp-042", "seq": 100, "state_snapshot": {"active_tasks": ["task-001"], "channels": ["ch-001"]}, "timestamp": "2026-04-10T14:35:00Z"}

```

When reconnecting, clients MAY provide the checkpoint ID instead of a
sequence number. The server resumes from the checkpoint state rather
than replaying individual events.

### 8.9 Stream Authentication Refresh

For long-lived streams, authentication tokens may expire. The
`stream.auth_refresh` event signals that the client should provide a
new token:

```
event: stream.auth_refresh
data: {"reason": "token_expiring", "expires_in_seconds": 60}

```

The client SHOULD disconnect and reconnect with a fresh token before
the existing token expires.

---

## 9. Sessions

### 9.1 Overview

Sessions provide stateful context across multiple messages between two
agents. Sessions are OPTIONAL (Level 4+).

Sessions may be established in two ways:

1. **Explicit handshake**: A three-phase protocol that negotiates
   capabilities and establishes cryptographic binding.
2. **Implicit sessions**: The sender includes a `Session-Id` header
   without a prior handshake. The receiver MAY accept or reject the
   implicit session.

### 9.2 Three-Phase Handshake

#### 9.2.1 Phase 1: Init

The client sends a `session.init` message to propose a new session:

```http
POST /agent/message HTTP/1.1
Host: bakery.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sender": "agent://alice@registry.example.com",
  "recipient": "agent://bakery.example.com",
  "id": "msg-init-001",
  "body_type": "session.init",
  "headers": {
    "Protocol-Version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "body": {
    "proposed_capabilities": ["messaging", "tools", "streaming"],
    "proposed_version": "1.0.0",
    "client_nonce": "a3f2b8c1d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1",
    "conversation_id": "conv-bakery-order-001",
    "previous_session_id": null
  }
}
```

**`client_nonce` requirements:**
- MUST be a 256-bit (64 hex character) cryptographically random value.
- MUST be globally unique.
- Implementations SHOULD use `secrets.token_hex(32)` or equivalent.

#### 9.2.2 Phase 2: Established

The server responds with a `session.established` message:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sender": "agent://bakery.example.com",
  "recipient": "agent://alice@registry.example.com",
  "id": "msg-est-001",
  "body_type": "session.established",
  "headers": {
    "In-Reply-To": "msg-init-001",
    "Session-Id": "sess-a1b2c3d4"
  },
  "body": {
    "session_id": "sess-a1b2c3d4",
    "negotiated_capabilities": ["messaging", "tools"],
    "negotiated_version": "1.0.0",
    "trust_tier": "verified",
    "trust_score": 650,
    "session_ttl_seconds": 3600,
    "server_nonce": "b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5",
    "binding_token": "hmac-sha256-derived-token-here",
    "resumed": false
  }
}
```

The `negotiated_capabilities` field contains the intersection of the
client's proposed capabilities and the server's supported capabilities.

#### 9.2.3 Phase 3: Confirm

The client proves possession of the binding token:

```http
POST /agent/message HTTP/1.1
Host: bakery.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sender": "agent://alice@registry.example.com",
  "recipient": "agent://bakery.example.com",
  "id": "msg-confirm-001",
  "body_type": "session.confirm",
  "headers": {
    "Session-Id": "sess-a1b2c3d4"
  },
  "body": {
    "session_id": "sess-a1b2c3d4",
    "binding_proof": "hmac-sha256-proof-of-binding-token"
  }
}
```

After the server validates the binding proof, the session transitions
to ACTIVE.

### 9.3 Session Binding (HMAC-SHA256)

Session binding prevents session hijacking by requiring the client to
prove it participated in the handshake.

#### 9.3.1 Token Derivation

Both parties compute:

```
binding_token = HMAC-SHA256(
  key   = shared_secret,
  msg   = client_nonce + "\x00" + server_nonce + "\x00" + session_id
)
```

Where `shared_secret` is a pre-shared key established out-of-band or
derived from the authentication process.

#### 9.3.2 Per-Message Binding

Every message within a bound session includes a `Session-Binding`
header containing:

```
Session-Binding = HMAC-SHA256(
  key   = binding_token,
  msg   = session_id + "\x00" + message_id
)
```

The receiver MUST verify this HMAC using constant-time comparison to
prevent timing side-channel attacks.

### 9.4 Session State Machine

Sessions follow a well-defined state machine:

```

| CONFIRMED     | close                | CLOSED         |

Implementations MUST reject transitions not listed in this table.

### 9.5 Session Keepalive

Active sessions are kept alive via ping/pong messages:

**Ping:**
```json
{
  "body_type": "session.ping",
  "body": {
    "session_id": "sess-a1b2c3d4",
    "timestamp": "2026-04-10T14:45:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Pong:**
```json
{
  "body_type": "session.pong",
  "body": {
    "session_id": "sess-a1b2c3d4",
    "timestamp": "2026-04-10T14:45:00Z",
    "active_tasks": 2
  }
}
```

### 9.6 Session Pause and Resume

**Pause:**
```json
{
  "body_type": "session.pause",
  "body": {
    "session_id": "sess-a1b2c3d4",
    "reason": "Client going offline temporarily",
    "resume_token": "rt-xyz-789"
  }
}
```

**Resume:**
```json
{
  "body_type": "session.resume",
  "body": {
    "session_id": "sess-a1b2c3d4",
    "resume_token": "rt-xyz-789"
  }
}
```

If a `resume_token` was issued during pause, it MUST be provided
during resume. Implementations SHOULD reject resume attempts without
a valid token when one was issued.

### 9.7 Session Close

```json
{
  "body_type": "session.close",
  "body": {
    "session_id": "sess-a1b2c3d4",
    "reason": "Task complete, ending conversation"
  }
}
```

After close, the session ID MUST NOT be reused. Any messages referencing
a closed session MUST be rejected with HTTP 410 (Gone).

### 9.8 Implicit Sessions

A sender MAY include a `Session-Id` header on any message without
performing a handshake. This creates an implicit session with the
following properties:

- No capability negotiation (sender assumes the receiver supports
  the required capabilities).
- No cryptographic binding (session ID alone is the session token).
- No guaranteed session TTL.

Receivers MAY accept or reject implicit sessions. If the receiver
requires explicit handshake, it MUST respond with a `task.reject`
body containing `"reason": "handshake_required"`.

Content-Type: application/problem+json

{
  "type": "urn:amp:error:not-found",
  "title": "Tool Not Found",
  "status": 404,
  "detail": "No tool named 'unknown_tool' exists"
}
```

### 10.3 Tool Consent

Tools with `consent_required: true` MUST NOT be invoked without a
prior consent grant.

#### 10.3.1 Consent Request

Sent via `POST /agent/message` with body type `tool.consent_request`:

```json
{
  "body_type": "tool.consent_request",
  "body": {
    "tool_name": "place_order",
    "scopes": ["payment:authorize", "order:create"],
    "reason": "Need to place a bakery order on behalf of the user",
    "session_id": "sess-a1b2c3d4",
    "ttl_seconds": 3600
  }
}
```

#### 10.3.2 Consent Grant

```json
{
  "body_type": "tool.consent_grant",
  "body": {
    "tool_name": "place_order",
    "scopes": ["payment:authorize", "order:create"],
    "grant_id": "grant-xyz-001",
    "valid_for_session": "sess-a1b2c3d4",
    "expires_at": "2026-04-10T15:30:00Z",
    "restrictions": {
      "max_invocations": 3,
      "max_amount_usd": 50.00
    }
  }
}
```

#### 10.3.3 Consent Semantics

- A grant is scoped to a specific session (`valid_for_session`).
- A grant has an expiration time (`expires_at`).
- A grant MAY include `restrictions` limiting how the tool can be used.
- Once a grant expires or the session closes, the grant is void.
- The granting agent MAY revoke consent at any time using
  `data.consent_revoke`.

### 10.4 Tool Detail

```
GET /agent/tools/{name}
```

Returns the full schema for a single tool. Response format is the same
as a single element of the `tools` array from `GET /agent/tools`.

## 11. Task Lifecycle -- Level 3

Tasks are the primary unit of work in AMP. A task progresses through a
well-defined set of states, each communicated via a specific body type.

### 11.1 Task State Diagram

```

### 11.2 Creating Tasks

Tasks are created by sending a `task.create` or `task.delegate` message
via `POST /agent/message`:

```json
{
  "body_type": "task.create",
  "body": {
    "description": "Find the nearest open bakery",
    "priority": "normal",
    "timeout_seconds": 300,
    "tools_required": ["search_bakeries"],
    "context": {
      "location": "40.7128,-74.006"
    }
  }
}
```

The receiver responds with one of:

| Response Body Type   | HTTP Status | Meaning                       |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| `task.acknowledge`   | 202         | Task accepted for processing  |
| `task.complete`      | 200         | Task completed synchronously  |
| `task.reject`        | 200         | Task declined                 |
| `task.error`         | 200         | Task failed immediately       |

### 11.3 Progress Updates

While processing, the receiver sends `task.progress` messages to report
incremental status:

```json
{
  "body_type": "task.progress",
  "body": {
    "task_id": "task-001",
    "percentage": 45,
    "message": "Found 3 bakeries, checking availability",
    "estimated_remaining_seconds": 15
  }
}
```

Progress updates are delivered via the callback URL, streaming, or
queued for polling.

### 11.4 Input Required

If the receiver needs additional information to proceed:

```json
{
  "body_type": "task.input_required",
  "body": {
    "task_id": "task-001",
    "reason": "Multiple bakeries found",
    "prompt": "Which bakery would you prefer?",
    "options": ["La Boulangerie", "Gluten-Free Heaven", "Corner Bakery"],
    "timeout_seconds": 120
  }
}
```

The sender responds with a `task.response`:

```json
{
  "body_type": "task.response",
  "body": {
    "task_id": "task-001",
    "text": "La Boulangerie"
  }
}
```

### 11.5 Task Completion

```json
{
  "body_type": "task.complete",
  "body": {
    "task_id": "task-001",
    "result": {
      "bakery": "La Boulangerie",
      "order_id": "ORD-001",
      "items": [{"item": "croissant", "qty": 2}],
      "total_usd": 7.50
    },
    "duration_seconds": 12.3,
    "cost_usd": 0.002,
    "cost_receipt": {
      "agent": "agent://bakery.example.com",
      "cost_usd": 0.002,
      "breakdown": {"llm_tokens": 1500, "tool_calls": 2}
    }
  }
}
```

### 11.6 Task Error

```json
{
  "body_type": "task.error",
  "body": {
    "task_id": "task-001",
    "reason": "bakery_closed",
    "detail": "La Boulangerie is closed on Sundays",
    "retry_eligible": true,
    "retry_after_seconds": 86400,
    "partial_result": {
      "bakeries_checked": 3
    }
  }
}
```

### 11.7 Task Polling

```
GET /agent/tasks/{task_id}
```

Returns the current state of a task:

```json
{
  "task_id": "task-001",
  "status": "processing",
  "body_type": "task.progress",
  "progress": {
    "percentage": 75,
    "message": "Placing order at La Boulangerie"
  },
  "created_at": "2026-04-10T14:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-04-10T14:30:08Z"
}
```

### 11.8 Task Cancellation

The sender cancels a task using `task.reroute` with `action: "cancel"`:

```json
{
  "body_type": "task.reroute",
  "body": {
    "task_id": "task-001",
    "action": "cancel",
    "reason": "User changed their mind"
  }
}
```

### 11.9 Task Escalation

The receiver escalates a task when it cannot complete it:

```json
{
  "body_type": "task.escalate",
  "body": {
    "task_id": "task-001",
    "escalate_to": "sender_human",
    "reason": "Payment requires human authorization",
    "partial_result": {
      "bakery": "La Boulangerie",
      "items_selected": [{"item": "croissant", "qty": 2}]
    }
  }
}
```

Escalation targets:

| Value           | Meaning                                        |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `sender_human`  | Route to the sender's human operator           |
| `local_human`   | Route to the receiver's human operator         |
| `specific`      | Route to a specific agent (set `target` field) |

### 11.10 Task Transfer

Transfers task ownership to another agent:

```json
{
  "body_type": "task.transfer",
  "body": {
    "task_id": "task-001",
    "transfer_to": "agent://specialty-bakery.example.com",
    "reason": "Specialized gluten-free agent can handle this better",
    "context": {"dietary": "no-gluten"},
    "partial_result": {"bakeries_checked": 2}
  }
}
```

### 11.11 Task Delegation

Delegation creates a chain of trust where agents delegate work to
sub-agents:

```json
{
  "body_type": "task.delegate",
  "body": {
    "task_id": "task-002",
    "description": "Search for bakeries within 5km",
    "delegation_chain": [
      {
        "delegator": "agent://alice@registry.example.com",
        "delegate": "agent://bakery.example.com",
        "scopes": ["tool:search_bakeries", "tool:place_order"],
        "max_depth": 3,
        "created_at": "2026-04-10T14:30:00Z",
        "expires_at": "2026-04-10T15:30:00Z",
        "signature": "base64-ed25519-signature",
        "max_fan_out": 3,
        "trust_tier": "verified",
        "chain_budget": "remaining=5.00USD;max=10.00USD"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 11.11.1 Delegation Chain Validation

Receivers MUST validate each link in a delegation chain:

1. **Public key lookup**: The delegator's public key MUST be available
   (via JWKS or pre-registered).
2. **Signature verification**: The Ed25519 signature over the canonical
   JSON (sorted keys, no whitespace, excluding the `signature` field)
   MUST be valid.
3. **Expiry check**: The link MUST NOT be expired (with clock skew
   tolerance of 60 seconds).
4. **Depth check**: The hop index MUST NOT exceed the parent link's
   `max_depth`.
5. **Scope narrowing**: Each link's scopes MUST be a subset of the
   parent link's scopes. Wildcard matching is supported (e.g.,
   `tool:*` allows `tool:read`).
6. **Chain continuity**: Each link's `delegator` MUST equal the
   previous link's `delegate`.
7. **Temporal nesting**: Each link's validity window MUST be within
   the parent link's window (with clock skew tolerance).
8. **Self-delegation**: A link MUST NOT have the same agent as both
   `delegator` and `delegate`.

### 11.12 Task Redirect

The receiver redirects the sender to a different agent:

```json
{
  "body_type": "task.redirect",
  "body": {
    "task_id": "task-001",
    "redirect_to": "agent://specialty-bakery.example.com",
    "reason": "This agent specializes in gluten-free orders"
  }
}
```

### 11.13 Task Revocation

The delegator revokes a previously delegated task:

```json
{
  "body_type": "task.revoke",
  "body": {
    "task_id": "task-002",
    "reason": "Delegation authority expired",
    "revoked_by": "agent://alice@registry.example.com"
  }
}
```

---

## 12. Security

### 12.1 Authentication

Authentication is OPTIONAL. An agent with no authentication requirement
treats all senders as EXTERNAL trust tier.

Implementations that require authentication MUST support at least one
of the following methods.

#### 12.1.1 Bearer JWT

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

- The JWT MUST be signed using an algorithm supported by the receiver
  (Ed25519/EdDSA is RECOMMENDED).
- The JWT SHOULD include `iss` (issuer), `sub` (subject), `exp`
  (expiration), and `iat` (issued at) claims.
- The receiver MUST verify the signature against the sender's JWKS.
- Valid JWT authentication resolves to trust tier OWNER.

#### 12.1.2 DID Proof

```http
Authorization: DID did:web:alice.example.com:proof:abc123
```

- The proof MUST be a verifiable presentation per the W3C DID
  specification.
- Valid DID authentication resolves to trust tier VERIFIED.

#### 12.1.3 API Key

```http
Authorization: ApiKey sk-abc123def456
```

- API keys MUST be transmitted only over HTTPS.
- Implementations SHOULD hash stored API keys.
- Valid API key authentication resolves to trust tier VERIFIED.

#### 12.1.4 Mutual TLS (mTLS)

- mTLS authentication is implicit -- the client presents a certificate
  during TLS handshake.
- No `Authorization` header is needed.
- Valid mTLS authentication resolves to trust tier VERIFIED.

#### 12.1.5 No Authentication

If no `Authorization` header is present and no mTLS certificate is
presented, the sender is assigned trust tier EXTERNAL.

### 12.2 Trust Tiers

Every message is processed within a trust context. The trust tier
determines which security checks apply.

| Tier       | Description                                      | Resolution                     |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| INTERNAL   | Same organization, same platform                 | Platform-internal mechanism    |
| OWNER      | The agent's registered owner/operator            | Valid JWT from registered owner |
| VERIFIED   | Authenticated agent, not owner                   | Valid DID, API key, or mTLS    |
| EXTERNAL   | Unknown or unauthenticated agent                 | No valid credentials           |

#### 12.2.1 Trust Tier Properties

| Property              | INTERNAL | OWNER | VERIFIED | EXTERNAL |
|-----------------------|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| Requires auth check   | No       | No    | No       | Yes      |
| Requires rate limit   | No       | No    | Yes      | Yes      |
| Requires content filter | No     | No    | No       | Yes      |
| Requires budget check | No       | Yes   | Yes      | Yes      |
| Requires loop detection | No     | No    | Yes      | Yes      |
| Can delegate          | Yes      | Yes   | Yes      | No       |

### 12.3 Trust Scoring

In addition to categorical trust tiers, AMP defines a numeric trust
score (0--1000) computed from five independent factors:

| Factor              | Max Points | Description                                |
|---------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| AGE                 | 200        | How long the agent has existed             |
| TRACK_RECORD        | 200        | Number of successful interactions          |
| CLEAN_HISTORY       | 200        | Absence of incidents (penalty-based)       |
| ENDORSEMENTS        | 200        | Peer endorsements received                 |
| IDENTITY_STRENGTH   | 200        | Cryptographic identity method strength     |

**Identity method scores:**

| Method     | Points |
|------------|--------|
| `did:key`  | 50     |
| `did:web`  | 100    |
| `jwt`      | 150    |
| `mtls`     | 200    |

**Score-to-tier mapping:**

| Score Range | Tier       | Rate Limit (req/min) | Content Filter |
|-------------|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 800--1000   | internal   | 1000                 | Off            |
| 400--799    | verified   | 100                  | Off            |
| 100--399    | external   | 10                   | On             |
| 0--99       | external   | 1                    | On             |

Note: The OWNER tier is assigned by the trust resolver based on
registration metadata, not by the numeric score.

The trust score is communicated via the `Trust-Score` header.

### 12.4 Rate Limiting

Implementations SHOULD enforce rate limits on EXTERNAL and VERIFIED
tier senders.

- The RECOMMENDED default rate limit is 60 requests per minute per
  sender.
- Rate limit state MUST be communicated via response headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 42
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1712765400
```

- When the limit is exceeded, the response MUST be HTTP 429 with a
  `Retry-After` header and an error body per Section 7.2.10.

### 12.5 Message Deduplication

Implementations SHOULD track message IDs for deduplication.

- The RECOMMENDED dedup window is 300 seconds.
- The RECOMMENDED maximum tracked IDs is 100,000.
- When a duplicate message is detected, the implementation SHOULD
  return the original response rather than reprocessing.
- Implementations MUST NOT reject a message solely because the dedup
  store is full; when the store is full, the oldest entries SHOULD be
  evicted.

### 12.6 Nonce Replay Protection

Implementations SHOULD track nonces for replay protection.

- The RECOMMENDED nonce window is 300 seconds (5 minutes). This aligns with industry standards (OWASP, OAuth2). Deployments on slow networks MAY increase this value.
- When a replayed nonce is detected, the implementation MUST reject the
  message with HTTP 409 and an error body per Section 7.2.7.

### 12.7 Sender Tracking

Implementations SHOULD track sender behavior to detect abuse.

- The RECOMMENDED failure threshold is 3 consecutive failures before
  temporary blocking.
- Blocked senders SHOULD receive HTTP 429 responses.
- Implementations SHOULD automatically unblock senders after a
  cooldown period.

### 12.8 Callback URL Validation

When a message includes a `Callback-URL` header:

1. The URL MUST use the HTTPS scheme.
2. The URL MUST NOT resolve to a private (RFC 1918), loopback, or
   link-local IP address.
3. The implementation SHOULD perform a HEAD request to verify
   reachability before accepting the message.
4. The implementation SHOULD pin DNS resolution on the first lookup and
   reuse the resolved IP for all delivery attempts.

### 12.9 Circuit Breaker

Implementations SHOULD implement circuit breaker patterns for outbound
calls (callbacks, delegation, federation):

- **CLOSED**: Normal operation.
- **OPEN**: All calls fail-fast. Set after consecutive failures exceed
  a threshold.
- **HALF_OPEN**: Allow a probe request. If it succeeds, transition to
  CLOSED; if it fails, return to OPEN.

Circuit state MAY be communicated via the `X-Circuit-State`,
`X-Circuit-Failures`, and `X-Circuit-Reset-At` headers.

### 12.10 Concurrency Limiting

Implementations SHOULD limit the number of concurrent tasks being
processed.

- The RECOMMENDED default limit is 50 concurrent tasks.
- When the limit is reached, new tasks SHOULD be rejected with HTTP 503
  and a `Retry-After` header.
- The agent's `constraints.max_concurrent_tasks` field in `agent.json`
  declares this limit.

### 12.11 End-to-End Encryption

AMP supports end-to-end encryption of message bodies using JWE
(JSON Web Encryption).

When the `Content-Encryption` header is present, the `body` field of
the `AgentMessage` envelope contains an `EncryptedBody` object:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "ciphertext": "base64-encoded-encrypted-payload",
    "iv": "base64-encoded-initialization-vector",
    "tag": "base64-encoded-authentication-tag",
    "algorithm": "A256GCM",
    "recipient_key_id": "key-2026-04"
  }
}
```

- The `recipient_key_id` MUST reference a key in the recipient's JWKS.
- The `algorithm` MUST be a registered JWE encryption algorithm.
- The receiver MUST decrypt the body before processing the `body_type`.

### 12.12 Key Revocation

Agents MAY revoke compromised keys by sending a `key.revocation`
message:

```json
{
  "body_type": "key.revocation",
  "body": {
    "key_id": "key-2025-12",
    "reason": "compromised",
    "revoked_at": "2026-04-10T14:00:00Z",
    "replacement_key_id": "key-2026-04",
    "signed_by": "key-2026-04"
  }
}
```

Valid revocation reasons: `compromised`, `superseded`, `retired`.

The receiver MUST validate that the revocation message is signed by a
non-revoked key.

### 12.13 Anti-Abuse Challenges

Implementations MAY challenge suspicious senders before processing
their messages:

**Challenge:**
```json
{
  "body_type": "task.challenge",
  "body": {
    "challenge_type": "proof_of_work",
    "challenge_data": "solve-this-hash-prefix",
    "expires_at": "2026-04-10T14:35:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "body_type": "task.challenge_response",
  "body": {
    "challenge_type": "proof_of_work",
    "solution": "nonce-that-produces-required-prefix"
  }
}
```

Challenge reasons: `rate_exceeded`, `new_sender`, `suspicious_pattern`,
`high_value_operation`.

The RECOMMENDED challenge expiry is 300 seconds.

### 12.14 Distributed Tracing

AMP supports W3C Trace Context-inspired tracing across agent
boundaries.

| Header          | Format              | Description                     |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| `Trace-Id`      | 32 hex chars (128-bit) | Trace identifier              |
| `Span-Id`       | 16 hex chars (64-bit)  | Span identifier               |
| `Parent-Span-Id` | 16 hex chars (64-bit) | Parent span identifier (optional) |

- When receiving a message with `Trace-Id` and `Span-Id`, the receiver
  SHOULD create a new span with the received span as parent.
- When initiating a message with no existing trace context, the sender
  SHOULD generate new trace and span IDs.

---

## 13. Compliance

### 13.1 Content Classification

Messages MAY include a `Content-Classification` header indicating the
sensitivity of the content:

| Classification  | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `public`        | No restrictions on handling                      |
| `internal`      | Organization-internal, not for public disclosure |
| `pii`           | Contains personally identifiable information     |
| `sensitive-pii` | Contains sensitive PII (health, financial, etc.) |
| `confidential`  | Highest sensitivity, restricted access           |

Receivers SHOULD enforce handling rules appropriate to the
classification. For example, `pii` and `sensitive-pii` content
SHOULD be subject to retention policies and erasure requirements.

### 13.2 Erasure

AMP supports GDPR-style erasure requests:

#### 13.2.1 Erasure Request

```json
{
  "body_type": "data.erasure_request",
  "body": {
    "subject_id": "user-12345",
    "subject_proof": "signed-identity-token",
    "scope": "all",
    "reason": "user_request",
    "deadline": "2026-05-10T00:00:00Z",
    "callback_url": "https://controller.example.com/erasure-callback"
  }
}
```

| Field           | Description                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `subject_id`    | Unique identifier of the data subject                    |
| `subject_proof` | Proof of identity (signed token)                         |
| `scope`         | `all`, `conversations`, `tasks`, or `tools`              |
| `reason`        | `user_request`, `account_deletion`, `consent_withdrawn`, `legal_order` |
| `deadline`      | ISO 8601 deadline for completion                         |
| `callback_url`  | URL to notify when erasure is complete (OPTIONAL)        |

#### 13.2.2 Erasure Response

```json
{
  "body_type": "data.erasure_response",
  "body": {
    "subject_id": "user-12345",
    "status": "completed",
    "records_deleted": 47,
    "categories_deleted": ["messages", "task_history", "tool_logs"],
    "retained": [
      {
        "category": "audit_logs",
        "reason": "Legal retention requirement (SOC2)",
        "retention_until": "2027-04-10T00:00:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "completed_at": "2026-04-11T08:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Erasure status: `completed`, `partial`, `failed`.

#### 13.2.3 Erasure Propagation

When an agent delegates tasks to sub-agents, erasure requests MUST be
propagated through the delegation chain. The propagation status is
communicated via `erasure.propagation_status`:

```json
{
  "body_type": "erasure.propagation_status",
  "body": {
    "original_request_id": "erasure-001",
    "status": "propagating",
    "agents_notified": 3,
    "agents_completed": 1,
    "agents_failed": 0
  }
}
```

### 13.3 Consent Management

#### 13.3.1 Consent Request

```json
{
  "body_type": "data.consent_request",
  "body": {
    "requester": "agent://bakery.example.com",
    "target": "agent://alice@registry.example.com",
    "scopes": ["read:order_history", "write:preferences"],
    "reason": "To personalize bakery recommendations",
    "ttl_seconds": 86400
  }
}
```

#### 13.3.2 Consent Response

    "target": "agent://alice@registry.example.com",
    "scopes": ["read:order_history"],
    "approved": true,
    "expires_at": "2026-04-11T14:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

#### 13.3.3 Consent Revocation

```json
{
  "body_type": "data.consent_revoke",
  "body": {
    "grant_id": "consent-grant-001",
    "reason": "User withdrew consent"
  }
}
```

### 13.4 Data Export

```json
{
  "body_type": "data.export_request",
  "body": {
    "subject_id": "user-12345",
    "subject_proof": "signed-identity-token",
    "scope": "all",
    "format": "json",
    "callback_url": "https://controller.example.com/export-callback"
  }
}
```

### 13.5 Jurisdiction

The `Jurisdiction` header declares the legal jurisdiction governing the
message:

```
Jurisdiction: US
```

The value MUST be an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.

When sender and receiver are in different jurisdictions, implementations
SHOULD evaluate whether the data exchange complies with applicable
cross-border transfer regulations.

### 13.6 Data Residency

The `Data-Residency` header declares the required data residency region:

```
Data-Residency: EU
```

Receivers MUST NOT store data outside the declared residency region if
one is specified.

### 13.7 Audit Attestation

Agents MAY publish attestation records for audit purposes:

```json
{
  "body_type": "audit.attestation",
  "body": {
    "attestation_type": "processing_record",
    "period_start": "2026-04-01T00:00:00Z",
    "period_end": "2026-04-10T00:00:00Z",
    "summary": {
      "messages_processed": 15000,
      "erasure_requests_completed": 3,
      "consent_grants_active": 42
    },
    "signed_by": "key-2026-04"
  }
}
```

## 17. Capability Levels

### 17.1 Capability Groups

AMP defines 8 capability groups:

| Group       | Description                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `messaging` | Send and receive messages                          |
| `streaming` | Real-time processing events via SSE                |
| `tools`     | Discover and invoke callable tools                 |
| `identity`  | Handshake, verify, consent, revoke                 |
| `session`   | Start, resume, end, inject context                 |
| `delegation` | Delegate, progress, escalate, complete, abort     |
| `presence`  | Ping, status, capabilities advertisement           |
| `events`    | Notify, subscribe, unsubscribe, publish            |

### 17.2 Level Requirements

Each level requires specific capability groups:

| Level | Required Groups                                                    |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | (none)                                                             |
| 1     | `messaging`                                                        |
| 2     | `messaging`, `tools`                                               |
| 3     | `messaging`, `tools`, `streaming`                                  |
| 4     | `messaging`, `tools`, `streaming`, `identity`, `session`, `delegation`, `events` |
| 5     | All 8 groups                                                       |

The level is computed automatically: the highest level whose required
groups are all present in the agent's declared capabilities.

### 17.3 Level-Endpoint Mapping

| Level | Endpoints Unlocked                                               |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | `GET /.well-known/agent.json`, `GET /agent/health`              |
| 1     | `POST /agent/message`                                           |
| 2     | `GET /agent/tools`, `GET /agent/tools/{name}`, `POST /agent/tools/{name}` |
| 3     | `GET /agent/stream`, `GET /agent/tasks/{task_id}`               |
| 4     | Session handshake, identity verification, consent, delegation   |
| 5     | Presence, audit, registry, federation                           |

### 17.4 Capability Negotiation

During session handshake (Section 9.2), the client proposes capabilities
and the server responds with the intersection.

Without a session, capability negotiation MAY occur per-request via
headers:

1. Client sends `Capabilities: messaging,tools,streaming`.
2. Server responds with `Negotiated-Capabilities: messaging,tools` and
   `Negotiated-Level: 2`.
3. If capabilities were downgraded, server includes
   `Downgrade-Warning: Server supports 'streaming' but client does not`.

---

## 18. Extensibility

### 18.1 Custom Body Types

Implementations MAY define custom body types using reverse-domain
notation:

```
com.acme.custom.order_confirmation
org.openai.function_call
io.anthropic.tool_use
```

Custom body types MUST NOT use the bare dot-notation reserved for
protocol-defined types (e.g., `task.*`, `session.*`, `data.*`).

Receivers that do not understand a custom body type MUST NOT reject the
message at the transport level. They SHOULD accept the message and MAY
respond with `task.reject` indicating the body type is unsupported.

### 18.2 Custom Headers

Custom headers SHOULD use the `X-` prefix:

```
X-Acme-Request-Id: req-12345
X-Custom-Priority: platinum
```

Receivers MUST ignore custom headers they do not understand.

### 18.3 Extension Capabilities

The `capabilities` section of `agent.json` MAY include custom
capability groups using reverse-domain notation:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "groups": ["messaging", "tools", "com.acme.custom.payments"],
    "level": 2
  }
}
```

Custom capability groups do not affect the computed level (only standard
groups are considered).

### 18.4 Versioning

- The protocol version is declared in `agent.json` and communicated
  via the `Protocol-Version` header.
- Clients request a specific version via the `Accept-Version` header.
- The server MUST respond with the negotiated version in the
  `Protocol-Version` response header.
- If no `Accept-Version` is provided, the server uses its current
  default version.
- If the requested version is not supported, the server MUST return
  HTTP 406 (see Section 7.2.5).
- Version negotiation supports comma-separated preference lists:
  `Accept-Version: 1.0.0, 0.1.0`. The server picks the highest
  supported version from the list.

### 18.5 Sunset Header

When a protocol version is deprecated, the server SHOULD include a
`Sunset` header per RFC 7231:

```http
Sunset: Thu, 15 Jan 2027 00:00:00 GMT
```

---

## 19. Configuration Defaults

The following values are RECOMMENDED defaults. Implementations MAY use
different values and SHOULD declare their configuration in `agent.json`
under the `constraints` field.

## 20. Conformance

### 20.1 Level 0 Conformance (MANDATORY)

An implementation claiming Level 0 conformance MUST:

1. Serve a valid JSON document at `GET /.well-known/agent.json`
   containing at minimum `protocol_version`, `identifiers`, and
   `endpoint`.
2. Respond to `GET /agent/health` with a JSON object containing at
   minimum `status` and `protocol_version`.
3. Use HTTPS in production environments.
4. Return `Content-Type: application/json` for all JSON responses.

### 20.2 Level 1 Conformance

In addition to Level 0, an implementation claiming Level 1 conformance
MUST:

1. Accept `POST /agent/message` requests with
   `Content-Type: application/json`.
2. Parse the `AgentMessage` envelope (sender, recipient, id, body_type,
   headers, body).
3. Ignore unknown headers without error.
4. Accept unknown body types without returning a transport-level error.
5. Return responses as `AgentMessage` envelopes.
6. Return error responses using RFC 7807 Problem Details format.

### 20.3 Level 2 Conformance

In addition to Level 1, an implementation claiming Level 2 conformance
MUST:

1. Serve a tool list at `GET /agent/tools`.
2. Accept tool invocations at `POST /agent/tools/{name}`.
3. Return 404 for unknown tool names.
4. Enforce tool consent when `consent_required` is true.

### 20.4 Level 3 Conformance

In addition to Level 2, an implementation claiming Level 3 conformance
MUST:

1. Serve an SSE stream at `GET /agent/stream`.
2. Emit events using the defined event types (Section 8.4).
3. Include monotonically increasing `seq` values in event data.
4. Send heartbeat events at a regular interval.
5. Support reconnection via `Last-Event-ID`.
6. Serve task status at `GET /agent/tasks/{task_id}`.

### 20.5 Level 4 Conformance

In addition to Level 3, an implementation claiming Level 4 conformance
MUST:

1. Support the three-phase session handshake (Section 9.2).
2. Enforce session state machine transitions (Section 9.4).
3. Validate delegation chains per Section 11.11.1.
4. Support at least one authentication method (Section 12.1).
5. Resolve trust tiers from authentication credentials.

### 20.6 Level 5 Conformance

In addition to Level 4, an implementation claiming Level 5 conformance
MUST support all 8 capability groups (Section 17.1).

### 20.7 Testing Conformance

Conformance testing is performed using test vector files published
alongside this specification. A test vector file contains:

- A series of HTTP request/response pairs.
- Expected status codes for each request.
- Expected response body type for each request.
- Edge cases for error handling.

Implementations SHOULD pass all test vectors for their declared
conformance level.

## Appendix D: Security Pipeline Order

When processing an incoming `POST /agent/message` request,
implementations SHOULD apply security checks in the following order:

1. **Message size check** -- Reject if body exceeds limit (413).
2. **Deduplication** -- Check if message ID was recently seen. If
   duplicate, return the cached response.
3. **Version negotiation** -- Validate `Accept-Version` header. If
   unsupported, return 406.
4. **Body schema validation** -- Parse and validate the body against
   the body type schema. If invalid, return 400.
5. **Authentication** -- Parse `Authorization` header and resolve
   trust tier.
6. **Rate limiting** -- Check sender rate against their trust tier's
   limit. If exceeded, return 429.
7. **Sender tracking** -- Check sender failure history. If blocked,
   return 429.
8. **Concurrency check** -- Check current task count. If at capacity,
   return 503.
9. **Nonce replay check** -- Verify nonce has not been seen. If
   replayed, return 409.
10. **Session validation** -- If `Session-Id` is present, validate the
    session exists and is active. If expired, return 410.
11. **Session binding** -- If `Session-Binding` is present, verify the
    HMAC. If invalid, return 403.
12. **Delegation validation** -- If the body contains a delegation
    chain, validate all links per Section 11.11.1.
13. **Loop detection** -- Check `Visited-Agents` header for cycles.
    If loop detected, return 409.
14. **Compliance check** -- Evaluate content classification and
    jurisdiction constraints.
15. **Contact policy** -- Verify the sender is permitted to contact
    the agent per the visibility config.
16. **Dispatch** -- Route the message to the appropriate handler
    based on `body_type`.

This order ensures that cheap checks (size, dedup) are performed
before expensive checks (cryptographic verification, delegation
chain validation).

## Appendix E: Addressing

### E.1 The `agent://` URI Scheme

Every AMP agent has a canonical address using the `agent://` scheme.
Three address forms are defined:

#### E.1.1 Direct Host

```
agent://bakery.example.com
agent://192.168.1.50:8080
```

Resolution: Fetch `https://{host}/.well-known/agent.json`.

#### E.1.2 Registry Slug

```
agent://sales@acme.example.com
agent://my-bot@registry.example.com
```

Resolution: `GET https://{registry}/agent/resolve/{slug}`.

#### E.1.3 DID

```
agent://did:web:acme.example.com
agent://did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK
```

Resolution: W3C DID resolution per the DID specification.

### E.2 Parsing Rules

```
agent://{authority}

If authority contains "did:" → DID resolution
If authority contains "@"   → split into {slug}@{registry}, registry resolution
Otherwise                   → direct host resolution
```

### E.3 Internal Shorthand

Within a platform's boundary, bare slugs (`@data-processor`) are
acceptable as internal shorthand. They MUST be normalized to full
`agent://` URIs before cross-platform communication:

| Shorthand             | Normalized Form                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `@alice`              | `agent://alice@{default_registry}`       |
| `https://example.com` | `agent://example.com`                    |
| `example.com`         | `agent://example.com`                    |

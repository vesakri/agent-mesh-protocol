## Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| CRITICAL | 18 |
| HIGH | 30 |
| MEDIUM | 20 |

---

## 1. Security (16 issues)

### 1.1 DID Proof Accepted Without Signature Verification (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/trust/resolver.py:77-123`

The DID trust resolver accepts `did:key` proofs WITHOUT verifying the JWT signature. The code parses the payload but never checks the signature. An attacker can forge any DID identity.

**Exploit**: Craft JWT `header.{"did":"did:key:z6Mk..."}.fakesig` — passes as VERIFIED.

### 1.2 Empty Shared Secret in Session Binding (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/session/binding.py:60-86`

`derive_binding_token()` accepts empty `shared_secret` with no validation. Empty key = predictable HMAC. Attacker knowing the nonces (transmitted in plaintext during handshake) can forge Session-Binding headers.

### 1.3 Dedup/Nonce Tracker Memory Leak (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/security/nonce_tracker.py:20-32`, `ampro/security/dedup.py:24-28`

Both use cleanup-on-access pattern. If an attacker sends messages with unique IDs but no legitimate traffic triggers cleanup, the store grows unbounded. 100 msgs/sec × 3600s window = 360,000 entries before any cleanup.

### 1.4 Rate Limiter Unbounded Growth (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/security/rate_limiter.py:14-50`

Attacker rotating through 1M unique sender IDs causes `_requests` dict to grow to 1M entries. Same issue in `ApiKeyStore._failures` and `._blocked`.

### 1.5 Handshake State Machine Not Thread-Safe (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/session/handshake.py:234-276`

`transition()` reads `_state`, computes next state, writes `_state` — no lock. Concurrent threads can cause invalid state transitions.

### 1.6 No Key Exchange for Encryption (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/security/encryption.py:30-39`

`EncryptedBody` defines ciphertext/iv/tag/algorithm but no mechanism for agents to agree on encryption keys. `recipient_key_id` has no validation. No downgrade prevention — encrypted sessions can be silently switched to plaintext.

### 1.7 Key Revocation Has No Propagation (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/security/key_revocation.py:41-67`

Revocation message defined but no mechanism to reach agents that cached the old key. `jwks_url` is optional. Compromised keys remain trusted until TTL expires.

### 1.8 Challenge Response Has No Solution Validation (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/security/challenge.py:47-53`

The body type defines challenge/response but provides zero guidance on solution validation. Each implementation validates differently — no interoperability.

### 1.9 Nonce Reuse Across Sessions (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/session/binding.py` + `ampro/session/handshake.py`

No requirement that nonces be globally unique. Weak PRNG could repeat nonces, making binding tokens identical across sessions. No delimiter between concatenated nonce+session_id.

### 1.10 Trust Resolver Silent Downgrade (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/trust/resolver.py:53-74`

If JWT resolver module is missing or fails, silently downgrades to EXTERNAL tier. Only logged at DEBUG level. Attacker can cause resolver crash via malformed JWTs to force downgrade.

### 1.11 Stream Auth Token Not Validated (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/streaming/auth.py:13-22`

`StreamAuthRefreshEvent` token format unspecified. No signature. Attacker on network can inject fake auth refresh events to hijack streaming sessions.

### 1.12 No Channel Authentication (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/streaming/channel.py`

Any session can open any channel. No verification that `task_id` belongs to requesting agent. Data leakage between sessions possible.

### 1.13 Percent-Encoding Not Decoded (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/core/addressing.py`

`parse_agent_uri("agent://127%2e0%2e0%2e1")` doesn't decode percent-encoding. SSRF protection bypass possible.

### 1.14 Unicode Hostnames Not Normalized (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/core/addressing.py`

No NFKC normalization. Cyrillic homoglyphs pass as valid hostnames.

### 1.15 Cross-Verification Is Optional (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/identity/cross_verification.py`

Verification is async and not part of handshake. Agent can claim identifiers, use them, and verification fails after messages already delivered.

### 1.16 Clock Skew Tolerance Too Large (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/trust/tiers.py:58`

60-second tolerance enables replay attacks within that window. Combined with 3600s nonce window, creates exploitable gaps.

---

## 2. Data Integrity (12 issues)

### 2.1 Trust Score Accepts Negative Inputs (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/trust/score.py:97-104`

Only `CLEAN_HISTORY` has `max(0, ...)` guard. `age_days=-365` or `interactions=-1000` produce negative factors, corrupting tier assignment.

### 2.2 Floating-Point Cost Accumulation (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/delegation/cost_receipt.py:72`

`total_cost_usd += receipt.cost_usd` — IEEE 754 precision drift. 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3. Financial audits produce incorrect totals.

### 2.3 Currency Mixing in Cost Chains (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/delegation/cost_receipt.py:31`

`add_receipt()` sums costs without checking currencies match. Agent A reports USD, Agent B reports EUR — total is meaningless.

### 2.4 Unknown Body Types Bypass Validation (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/core/body_schemas.py`

`validate_body("x-attack.payload", {"shell_command": "..."})` returns raw dict with zero validation. Custom types have no sanitization.

### 2.5 Empty body_type Accepted (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/core/body_schemas.py`

`body_type=""` passes envelope validation and registry lookup returns None, silently treated as extension type.

### 2.6 Non-Dict Body Silently Becomes Empty (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/core/message_middleware.py`

`body = msg.body if isinstance(msg.body, dict) else {}` — string body silently becomes empty dict. Message content lost.

### 2.7 No Max String Length on Any Field (MEDIUM)
**File**: Multiple body schema models

`description="x" * 100_000_000` accepted. Database inserts, logging, and storage systems can crash.

### 2.8 Negative Cost/Timeout Values Accepted (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/core/body_schemas.py`

`estimated_cost_usd: float` has no `ge=0` constraint. `timeout_seconds: int` has no constraint. Negative values create invalid semantics.

### 2.9 Extra Fields Silently Ignored (MEDIUM)
**File**: All body models

`model_config = {"extra": "ignore"}` — typos in field names are silently discarded. Integration bugs go undetected.

### 2.10 No Checkpoint Schema Versioning (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/streaming/checkpoint.py`

`state_snapshot` schema not versioned. Agent upgrade changes snapshot format — old checkpoints crash on replay.

### 2.11 No Schema Versioning for agent.json (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/agent/schema.py`

`protocol_version` is protocol version, not schema version. Adding/removing fields has no versioning. Consumers don't know which fields to expect.

### 2.12 Stale Registry Results (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/registry/search.py`

No freshness indicator on search results. Endpoint may have gone offline since search returned it.

---

## 3. Availability (14 issues)

### 3.1 All Streaming State Lost on Restart (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/streaming/bus.py`

`_active_streams` is in-memory only. Server restart = all streams, events, ring buffers gone. No persistence.

### 3.2 No Distributed Deployment for Streaming (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/streaming/bus.py`

Single-process, single-machine. No message queue backend. Load balancing across instances impossible — sticky sessions required but undocumented.

### 3.3 SSE Reconnect Silently Drops Events (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/streaming/bus.py:94-105`

Ring buffer capacity is 100. If client reconnects after buffer has cycled, `replay_from()` returns empty list with no error. Silent data loss.

### 3.4 Backpressure Is Advisory Only (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/streaming/backpressure.py`

`stream.pause` has no enforcement. Misbehaving producer can ignore pause. No timeout for paused streams. No protocol-level penalty.

### 3.5 No Channel Limit (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/streaming/channel.py`

Client can open thousands of channels on single connection. No per-session quota. No cleanup on stale channels.

### 3.6 Unbounded Async Queue (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/streaming/bus.py:40-42`

`asyncio.Queue()` has no max size. Producer can enqueue infinitely many events. No error response on overflow.

### 3.7 No Handshake Timeout (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/session/handshake.py`

State machine enforces valid transitions but not time limits. Client can leave handshake stuck in INIT_SENT indefinitely. Server holds resources.

### 3.8 No Default Rate Limiting (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/core/message_middleware.py`

`check_message_size()` enforces 10MB limit but no rate limit per sender. Attackers flood with valid messages at no cost.

### 3.9 10MB × 100 Concurrent = 1GB Memory (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/core/message_middleware.py`

Default max 10MB per message. No per-sender memory limit. 100 concurrent messages = 1GB.

### 3.10 No Redirect Loop Detection (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/transport/task_redirect.py`

Agent A redirects to B, B redirects to A. Infinite loop. No max-hops limit in protocol.

### 3.11 Migration Chains Can Be Infinite (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/identity/migration.py`

`moved_to` can point to another agent with its own `moved_to`. No depth limit. A→B→C→...→Z = DoS via 26 HTTP requests.

### 3.12 Thundering Herd on agent.json TTL (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/agent/schema.py`

10,000 consumers cache agent.json with same TTL. All retry when TTL expires. DDoS spike on agent's endpoint.

### 3.13 No Federation Revocation (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/registry/federation.py`

Once federated, forever federated. Compromised registry continues sharing agents. No unilateral revocation mechanism.

### 3.14 Instant Decommissioning Allowed (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/agent/lifecycle.py`

Agent can jump from ACTIVE to DECOMMISSIONED with no grace period. In-flight tasks orphaned. No enforcement of draining.

---

## 4. Compliance (8 issues)

### 4.1 Jurisdiction Conflict Detection Is Naive (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/compliance/jurisdiction.py:38-64`

Algorithm: "no conflict if same primary or all sender frameworks exist in receiver." Real GDPR adequacy decisions expire, require binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses. False confidence in cross-border transfers.

### 4.2 Multi-Jurisdiction Semantics Undefined (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/compliance/types.py`

Agent with `primary=DE, additional=[US, SG]` — which rules apply? Ambiguous. Agent can claim whichever framework is most convenient.

### 4.3 Data Transit vs Storage Distinction Missing (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/compliance/data_residency.py`

Only checks stored residency. GDPR also governs data in transit. No way to declare transit path.

### 4.4 Region Strings Not Validated Against Reality (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/compliance/data_residency.py:17-44`

`region="totally-fake-region"` passes format validation. No registry of real regions. Self-certified, unverified.

### 4.5 Erasure Has No Retry for Offline Agents (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/compliance/erasure.py`

If downstream agent is offline during erasure propagation, no retry mechanism. GDPR mandates erasure within 30 days.

### 4.6 Partial Erasure Untrackable (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/compliance/types.py:57-64`

`retained` is free-form list. No schema to correlate which records remain at which downstream agent. GDPR audit fails.

### 4.7 Link Proofs Never Expire (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/identity/link.py`

No `expires_at` or `ttl_seconds`. Once linked, always linked. Compromised key keeps links valid forever.

### 4.8 Cached Visibility Changes Don't Propagate (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/agent/visibility.py`

If agent changes from PUBLIC to PRIVATE, cached agent.json stays public until TTL expires. No invalidation broadcast.

---

## 5. Protocol Gaps (18 issues)

### 5.1 No IPv6 Support (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/core/addressing.py`

`agent://[2001:db8::1]` fails parsing. IPv6-only networks broken.

### 5.2 No Port Number Support (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/core/addressing.py`

`agent://example.com:8080` treats `:8080` as part of hostname.

### 5.3 No Version Negotiation Fallback (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/core/versioning.py`

No common version = hard ValueError. No graceful degradation.

### 5.4 Inconsistent Error Handling (MEDIUM)
Envelope: no validation errors. Body schemas: pydantic.ValidationError. Addressing: ValueError. No unified error strategy.

### 5.5 No Registry Search Pagination (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/registry/search.py`

max_results capped at 100. No cursor. Can't browse beyond first page.

### 5.6 No Relevance Scoring Algorithm (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/registry/search.py`

"Ranked" results but no ranking algorithm defined. Different registries rank differently.

### 5.7 No Federation Sync Protocol (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/registry/federation.py`

How do agents from Registry-A appear in Registry-B? No sync protocol, no consistency guarantees.

### 5.8 No Federation Conflict Resolution (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/registry/types.py`

Same agent_uri in two federated registries with different endpoints. No resolution algorithm. MITM possible.

### 5.9 No Migration Acceptance Verification (CRITICAL)
**File**: `ampro/identity/migration.py`

New identity doesn't publish acceptance. Compromised old identity can falsely claim migration to unrelated new identity.

### 5.10 No Migration Chain Depth Limit (HIGH)
`moved_to` chains can grow arbitrarily. No cycle detection (A→B→A possible).

### 5.11 No Cache Invalidation Push (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/agent/schema.py`

TTL-based polling only. No push notification for changes. Thundering herd on TTL expiry.

### 5.12 Event Ordering Across Channels Undefined (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/streaming/channel.py`

No ordering guarantees between events from different channels. Replay can't reconstruct cross-channel ordering.

### 5.13 Large SSE Events Exceed Frame Limits (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/streaming/events.py:54-62`

No size limit on events. 10MB tool result → 20MB SSE line → TCP frame overflow.

### 5.14 No Checkpoint Size Limit (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/streaming/checkpoint.py`

`state_snapshot` unbounded. Long-running tasks accumulate gigabytes.

### 5.15 Headers Accept Non-String Types (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/core/envelope.py`

`headers: dict[str, Any]` allows dicts, lists as values. HTTP headers must be strings per RFC 7230.

### 5.16 No Sender/Recipient Length Validation (HIGH)
**File**: `ampro/core/envelope.py`

Unrestricted `str` fields. Gigabyte-sized sender URIs cause memory exhaustion.

### 5.17 Lazy Registration Silently Fails (MEDIUM)
**File**: `ampro/core/body_schemas.py`

`except ImportError: pass` means missing modules produce incomplete registries. Agents disagree on available body types.

### 5.18 Only Forward-Compatible Schema Evolution (MEDIUM)
New required fields break old versions. No backward compatibility strategy.

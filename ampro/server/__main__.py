# ─── Reference implementation, not production-wired ────────────────
# This module is part of the AMP protocol surface and is validated by
# the test suite against the normative spec at
# `docs/WIRE-BINDING.md`. It has no first-party runtime caller as of
# ampro v0.3.0; downstream implementers may depend on it directly, or
# provide their own implementation conforming to the same contract.
